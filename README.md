# Concrete-Strength-Prediction-Using-Deep-Learning-Keras-

This project builds and evaluates a regression model using the Keras deep learning library to predict concrete compressive strength. The experiment explores the impact of different model configurations, including data normalization, increasing training epochs, and adding hidden layers. The performance is measured using the mean squared error (MSE) to analyze how these changes affect model accuracy.

- Dataset: Concrete Compressive Strength Dataset
- Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn.
- Key Experiments:
      - Baseline Model (Single Hidden Layer, No Normalization)
      - Effect of Data Normalization
      - Increasing Training Epochs
      - Adding More Hidden Layers

ðŸ“Š Results & Insights: A comparative analysis of different configurations based on MSE, highlighting best practices for optimizing neural network regression models.

ðŸ’¡ Ideal for: Deep learning beginners, data science enthusiasts, and those interested in practical model tuning strategies.
